  <p>
    HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
  </p>

<p>
  One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.
</p>

  <p>
    The main parts of our element are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li><i>The opening tag:</i> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
      <li><i>The closing tag:</i> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
      <li><i>The content:</i> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
      <li><i>The element:</i> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
    <p><img id="image" src="https://i.postimg.cc/qNG0rMB2/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" /></p>
    Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute name and <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute value. The <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.
      <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
        <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
      </ol>
  </p>

    That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.Here, we have the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
      <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt</code> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
      </li>
      <li>
<code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>— This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</code>— This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.
      </li>
      <li>
&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
      </li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <p><b>Nesting</b></p>
    You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized.

  <header><h2>Pros and Cons of HTML</h2></header>
  
  <p>
    <h3><i>Pros of HTML</i></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Beginner-friendly:</i> HTML has a clean and consistent markup, as well as a shallow learning curve.</li>
      <li><i>Support:</i> The language is widely used, with a lot of resources and a large community behind it.</li>
      <li><i>Accessible:</i> It is open-source and completely free. HTML runs natively in all web browsers.</li>
      <li><i>Flexible:</i> HTML is easily integrable with backend languages such as PHP and Node.js.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

  <p>
    <h3><i>Cons of HTML</i></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Static:</i> The language is primarily used for static web pages. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a back-end language such as PHP.</li>
      <li><i>Separate HTML page:</i> Users have to create individual web pages for HTML, even if the elements are the same.</li>
      <li><i>Browser compatibility</i> Some browsers adopt new features slowly. Sometimes older browsers don’t always render newer tags.</li>
    </ul>

  <header><h2>Conclusion</h2></header>

  <p>
    HTML is the primary markup language found on the internet. Every HTML page has a series of elements that create the content structure of a web page or application. 
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML is a beginner-friendly language with plenty of support and is mainly used for static website pages. HTML works best together with CSS for the styling and JavaScript for the functionality. You can check out how to link CSS and HTML on our blog.
